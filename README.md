# SimpleChat

This is a simple chat program that I made that utilizes threads to serve any number of clients. I have also implemented an anti spam filter, and some basic permissions that can be established. I am working on creating some support documents/files that the program will use to show users how to do permissions and other things. It also has a log that I am working on making an on-off switch for.
